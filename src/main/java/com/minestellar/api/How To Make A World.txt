How to create world generation:
==================================
  1. Create your basic blocks, Grass, Dirt, and Stone. You really only need to make one but that is your choice.
  
  2. Create a file called 'DimensiomYOURWORLD' (replace YOURWORLD with the name of your planet). 
Reference com.minestellar.moon.world.DimensionMoon for any help needed.
 
  3. Next create 'WorldProviderYOURPLANET' it extends WorldProvider and implements MinestellarWorldProvider, 
you will get errors, just clock add implemented methods and it should create the correct methods you need. 
Customize these to your desire, reference com.minestellar.moon.world.WorldProviderMoon if a example.
 
  4. Create 'SkyRendererYOURWORLD' reference any one of these made in our worlds, 
this is a tricky file to customize but try your best.
 
  5. Next you have to create 'BiomeDecoratorYOURWORLD' 'BiomeGenBase' 'ChunkProviderYOURWORLD' and 
'WorldChunkManagerYOURWORLD', if you know enough about world generation just go at it, 
if not look at our planets code and even copy it if you need to. In 'ChunkProviderYOURWORLD', 
in the first lines under 'public class ChunkProviderYOURWORLD' change those names to your block(s) you created in step 1.



How to register your world, and get to it (basic):
==================================
  1. In your mods core file, go into 'preInit(FMLPreInitializationEvent event)' under there create
'DimensionYOURWORLD.registerWorldProvider();' and 'DimensionYOURWORLD.registerDimensions();' and import DimensionYOURWORLD.
 
  2. Next create a new block, this is temporary until we get dimension transfer right, create a portal just like the one in the Moon.
Then create a file called 'TeleporterYOURWORLD', 'BlockTeleporterYOURWORLD' and 'ItemBlockTeleporter'.
Copy the code from the moon, register the block AND YOU GOT A TEMPORARY PORTAL TO YOUR WORLD!!
